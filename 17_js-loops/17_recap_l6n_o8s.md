# Session Topic: JS Loops

## Understanding the concept of loops

_My summary:_
A loop is a statement which executes the block of code it contains under conditions set in the loop itself.

_revised_:

A loop is a control structure that repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true or until a specification criterion is met.

It's a statement and a component of JavaScript. It can be statement of a function.

_Keywords_:

- control structure
- iteration
- termination condition
- infinite loop
- execution flow

## Understanding the types of loops

No need to summarize here again, because I've already noted that down in my other notebook.
